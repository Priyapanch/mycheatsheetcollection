Hereâ€™s how a **Day in the Life of a Data Engineer vs. a Machine Learning Engineer** looks, especially in the context of AWS workflows:

---

## ðŸŸ¦ A Day of a **Data Engineer** (AWS Focused)

### 9:00 AM â€” Morning Sync & Pipeline Health Check

* Review overnight ETL jobs (Glue, EMR, Lambda)
* Check S3 bucket ingestion logs & Kinesis Data Streams
* Fix failed jobs or optimize Glue scripts (PySpark)

### 10:30 AM â€” Data Pipeline Development

* Design new ETL pipelines using AWS Glue & Step Functions
* Transform raw data into structured format for analytics
* Update Data Catalog (Glue Data Catalog, Athena schemas)

### 12:30 PM â€” Lunch Break

### 1:30 PM â€” Data Quality & Governance

* Define and automate data quality checks (Great Expectations, Lambda triggers)
* Manage access controls via IAM roles & S3 bucket policies
* Optimize storage formats (Parquet, ORC) for cost and performance

### 3:30 PM â€” Collaboration & Reviews

* Work with ML engineers to understand data needs
* Review Data Lineage and Compliance reports

### 4:30 PM â€” Performance Tuning & Cost Optimization

* Monitor Glue job metrics in CloudWatch
* Tune Spark configurations, partitioning strategies
* Archive old data to S3 Glacier

## ðŸŸ© A Day of a **Machine Learning Engineer** (AWS Focused)

### 9:00 AM â€” Morning Sync & Model Health Check

* Monitor deployed SageMaker endpoints (latency, drift)
* Review Model Monitor alerts & CloudWatch metrics
* Trigger retraining jobs if data drift detected

### 10:30 AM â€” Model Development & Training

* Develop and test ML models in SageMaker Notebooks
* Run experiments with Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs
* Test Bring Your Own Container (BYOC) for custom models

### 12:30 PM â€” Lunch Break

### 1:30 PM â€” Deployment & Automation

* Build SageMaker Pipelines for training â†’ deployment flow
* Test multi-model endpoints & batch inference jobs
* Integrate models with Lambda for real-time inference

### 3:30 PM â€” Collaboration & Reviews

* Sync with Data Engineers for new feature requirements
* Work with DevOps on CI/CD for ML models using CodePipeline

### 4:30 PM â€” Cost & Performance Optimization

* Optimize instance types (Spot, Elastic Inference)
* Review SageMaker Model Registry for versioning
* Archive unused models in S3
