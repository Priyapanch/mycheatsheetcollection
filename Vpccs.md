## 🧠 **AWS VPC Mind Map Cheat Sheet — With Exam Trap Scenarios**

---

### 🌐 **1. VPC Core Components**

* **CIDR Block** → Defines IP range.
* **Subnets** → Public & Private.
* **Internet Gateway (IGW)** → Public access.
* **NAT Gateway/Instance** → Private subnet outbound internet access.
* **Route Tables** → Direct traffic.
* **Elastic IP (EIP)** → Static public IP for NAT, Bastion.
* **Egress-Only IGW** → IPv6 outbound traffic.

### 🔐 **2. Security**

| Component                | Key Point                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Security Groups (SG)** | Stateful, allows return traffic.           |
| **Network ACLs (NACL)**  | Stateless, must define inbound & outbound. |
| **Flow Logs**            | Capture network traffic logs.              |
| **VPC Endpoints**        | Private connection to S3/DynamoDB.         |
| **AWS PrivateLink**      | Connect VPCs & services privately.         |

---

### 🛣️ **3. VPC Connectivity**

* **VPC Peering** → One-to-one VPC connection.
* **Transit Gateway** → Hub-and-spoke for multiple VPCs.
* **VPN Gateway** → Secure connection to on-prem.
* **Direct Connect** → Dedicated private line.
* **Reachability Analyzer** → Troubleshoot connectivity.
* **Network Access Analyzer** → Analyze unintended access.

## 🚨 **4. High-Yield Exam Trap Scenarios**

| **Scenario**                                                       | **Exam Trap**             | **Correct Answer**                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 in Private Subnet needs software updates from the internet** | Choosing Internet Gateway | Use **NAT Gateway**                                |
| **EC2 instance has no public IP, but needs internet access**       | Only IGW is enough        | Needs **EIP + NAT Gateway**                        |
| **Securely connect to S3 without internet access**                 | IGW/NAT Gateway           | Use **S3 Gateway VPC Endpoint**                    |
| **Access DynamoDB from private subnet**                            | NAT Gateway needed        | **DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint** (cheaper, no NAT)    |
| **Multiple VPCs need scalable connection**                         | VPC Peering               | Use **Transit Gateway**                            |
| **CIDR block overlapping in VPC Peering**                          | Assume it works           | **VPC Peering fails with overlapping CIDRs**       |
| **Outbound-only IPv6 traffic from private subnet**                 | NAT Gateway               | Needs **Egress-Only IGW**                          |
| **Restrict IP range access to EC2 in public subnet**               | Modify Route Table        | Use **Security Groups / NACLs**                    |
| **Need to capture network traffic logs for compliance**            | CloudWatch Logs           | Use **VPC Flow Logs**                              |
| **EC2 cannot reach RDS instance in private subnet**                | No SG rule considered     | Check **SG Inbound Rules & NACLs**                 |
| **Connecting on-prem to VPC with low-latency requirement**         | VPN Gateway               | Use **Direct Connect**                             |
| **Cross-account S3 access securely**                               | IGW                       | Use **VPC Endpoint + Resource-based Policy**       |
| **VPC Flow Logs are not capturing data**                           | Instance issue            | **IAM Role for VPC Flow Logs might be missing**    |
| **Bastion Host in Private Subnet**                                 | Won’t work                | **Bastion must be in Public Subnet with EIP**      |
| **Traffic inspection between subnets**                             | SGs enough                | Needs **AWS Network Firewall / Traffic Mirroring** |

## ✅ **Quick Trap Memory Hook**:

> **"PIN REST"** →
> **P**eering CIDR, **I**nternet Access (NAT vs Endpoint), **N**etwork ACLs,
> **R**eporting with Flow Logs, **E**gress IPv6 Trap, **S**G/NACL mixups, **T**ransit Gateway vs Peering.
