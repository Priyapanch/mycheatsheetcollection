# **Day 8: AWS Serverless Architectures Mastery**

## **Domain Focus:**
- Lambda
- API Gateway
- SQS, SNS
- EventBridge
- Step Functions

---

# **Scenario 1:**  
> **You want to expose your Lambda function through an HTTP endpoint for a mobile app. What's the best service?**

**Answer:**  
- **Amazon API Gateway** integrates with Lambda to expose HTTP APIs.

---

# **Scenario 2:**  
> **Your Lambda is triggered whenever a file is uploaded to an S3 bucket. How do you set it up?**

**Answer:**  
- Configure **S3 Event Notifications** to trigger the Lambda function on `s3:ObjectCreated:*`.

---

# **Scenario 3:**  
> **You need to process customer orders asynchronously. Which service fits best?**

**Answer:**  
- Use **SQS** to queue orders â†’ Lambda function polls SQS â†’ Processes the messages.

---

# **Scenario 4:**  
> **Multiple services must receive notifications when a new user registers. Which service?**

**Answer:**  
- **Amazon SNS** â€” publish-subscribe model to send notifications to multiple subscribers (Lambda, Email, HTTP endpoints).

---

# **Scenario 5:**  
> **You have a complex order fulfillment workflow needing multiple steps, retries, and error handling. Which service?**

**Answer:**  
- **AWS Step Functions** â€” orchestrates serverless workflows with built-in retries and error handling.

# **Serverless Exam Traps (Critical to Know)**

| Trap | Correct Thinking |
|:---|:---|
| Lambda can only be invoked synchronously | NO â€” Lambda can be invoked asynchronously too |
| Lambda can run forever | WRONG â€” Default max timeout = **15 minutes** |
| API Gateway automatically validates input | NO â€” Must configure request validation manually |
| SQS triggers Lambda immediately | NOT always â€” Lambda polls SQS, **long polling** strategy |
| SNS guarantees message delivery to all subscribers | No â€” **Best-effort**, must design retries or DLQs |

---

# **Memory Visual Hack**

**Lambda = Smart Worker**  
(Executes short tasks on demand.)

**API Gateway = Reception Desk**  
(Receives client requests, passes them to Lambda.)

**SQS = Waiting Room**  
(Messages wait patiently in a queue.)

**SNS = Loudspeaker**  
(Sends announcements to many listeners.)

**Step Functions = Manager**  
(Decides the order of tasks.)

# **Cheat Sheet #1: Lambda Event Sources**

| Event Source | Mode |
|:---|:---|
| API Gateway | Sync |
| S3 Event | Async |
| SQS | Polling |
| EventBridge | Async |
| DynamoDB Streams | Polling |

---

# **Cheat Sheet #2: Key Limits (Must Remember)**

| Service | Limit |
|:---|:---|
| Lambda Timeout | 15 minutes |
| Lambda Deployment Package | 50 MB zipped, 250 MB unzipped |
| API Gateway Payload Size | 10 MB max |
| SQS Message Size | 256 KB (standard) |

> **Answer:** B

---

### **Q5:**  
By default, how does Lambda get messages from SQS?

- A) Event push  
- B) Polling

# **Day 8 Summary Keywords to Memorize:**
> Lambda = On-Demand Execution â€” API Gateway = Front Door â€” SQS = Decoupling â€” SNS = Broadcast â€” Step Functions = Serverless Workflow Orchestration

---

# **Most Important Deep Dives (Real Exam Favorites)**

| Topic | Deep Tip |
|:---|:---|
| Lambda + VPC | Lambda can connect to RDS in VPC, but you must configure ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) |
| Lambda Cold Start | Happens when function is idle â€” keep it warm with scheduled invokes |
| API Gateway Caching | Enable caching to reduce Lambda loads |
| SQS Visibility Timeout | Set it longer than Lambda processing time to avoid double-processing |
| Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) | Use DLQs with SNS and Lambda for failure handling |
