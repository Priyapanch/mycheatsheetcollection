# **Day 7: AWS Security Best Practices for Developers**

## **Domain Focus:**  
- IAM Policies, Roles, Groups  
- Encryption (KMS, S3, RDS)  
- Secrets Management  
- Application Security Basics

---

# **Scenario 1:**  
> **Your Lambda function needs permission to read from an S3 bucket. What's the best way to grant access?**

**Answer:**  
- Attach an **IAM Role** to the Lambda function with S3 read policy.

**Memory Tip:**  
- Lambda â†’ Assume Role â†’ Policy grants permissions.

---

# **Scenario 2:**  
> **You want an EC2 instance to access an RDS database without hardcoding credentials. How?**

**Answer:**  
- Store credentials in **AWS Secrets Manager**.  
- EC2 retrieves them at runtime via IAM permissions.

---

# **Scenario 3:**  
> **You need to encrypt sensitive customer data before saving it to S3. Whatâ€™s the simplest method?**

**Answer:**  
- Use **S3 Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3)** or **SSE-KMS** for stronger control.

---

# **Scenario 4:**  
> **You want to audit who accessed S3, RDS, and Lambda. What AWS service provides this?**

**Answer:**  
- **AWS CloudTrail.**

**Bonus:**  
- Enable S3 Data Events in CloudTrail for object-level logging!

---

# **Scenario 5:**  
> **You need a way to rotate secrets (like DB passwords) automatically. Best service?**

**Answer:**  
- **AWS Secrets Manager** supports automatic secret rotation.

# **Critical AWS Security Pitfalls (Exam Traps)**

| Wrong Thinking | Correct Thinking |
|:---|:---|
| Always use Access Keys | WRONG â€” Prefer **IAM roles** (temporary credentials) |
| Hardcode secrets in apps | BAD â€” Use **Secrets Manager** |
| S3 buckets are private by default | TRUE â€” but watch out for public bucket policies |
| Encryption happens automatically | NO â€” You must **enable** it (S3 SSE, RDS encryption) |
| All IAM users need console passwords | No â€” Programmatic access only needs Access Keys |

---

# **Memory Visual Hack**

**IAM User = Human User**  
(Example: admin, devops engineer)

**IAM Role = Temporary Costume**  
(Example: Lambda assumes "s3-access" role.)

**Secrets Manager = Locker**  
(Encrypted password vault.)

**KMS = Safe Key**  
(Encrypts data encryption keys.)

---

# **Cheat Sheet #1: IAM Concepts**

| Concept | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **User** | Person or app needing long-term credentials |
| **Group** | Collection of users with shared permissions |
| **Role** | Temporary permissions assumed by AWS services |
| **Policy** | Document that defines allowed or denied actions |

---

# **Cheat Sheet #2: Encryption Options**

| Service | Encryption Type |
|:---|:---|
| **S3** | SSE-S3 (Amazon managed) or SSE-KMS (Customer managed keys) |
| **RDS** | Enable encryption at DB creation (uses KMS) |
| **DynamoDB** | Automatic encryption (AES-256) |

# **Security Pack Special (ðŸ”¥ Most Repeated MCQs on Real Exams)**

| Question | Correct Answer | Quick Tip |
|:---|:---|:---|
| IAM Role or Access Keys? | Role | Access keys should be avoided when possible |
| Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store? | Secrets Manager | When auto-rotation is needed |
| CloudTrail enabled by default? | Partially | Management Events are on, but Data Events must be enabled |
| S3 Encryption Types? | SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS | Know difference! |
| Data key vs Master key? | Master key encrypts data keys | (Important for KMS understanding) |
