Got it ✅
You want two things now:

1. A very clear folder/project structure (enterprise-style) to show in your POC.


2. A step-by-step creation guide in UiPath Studio (console) without relying on only the UiPath wizards/templates (since they add overhead and slow you down).



Let’s do this systematically.


---

🔹 1. Suggested UiPath Project Structure for Test Automation Framework

📂 UiPath-Test-Automation-Framework
│── 📂 Libraries
│   │── CommonControls
│   │    ├── Login.xaml
│   │    ├── ValidateHomePage.xaml
│   │    ├── ValidateUserName.xaml
│   │    ├── SelectMainMenu.xaml
│   │    ├── SelectSubMenu.xaml
│   │    ├── ValidateAccountGrid.xaml
│   │    ├── ClickAction.xaml
│   │    ├── SelectTransactionType.xaml
│   │    ├── SelectTransactionGrid.xaml
│   │    └── ValidateTotalTransactions.xaml
│   │── DBHelper.xaml
│   │── APIHelper.xaml
│   │── AWSHelper.xaml
│
│── 📂 BusinessFlows
│   │── ApproveFlow.xaml
│   │── RejectFlow.xaml
│   │── CancelFlow.xaml
│
│── 📂 TestCases
│   │── TC_Approve_Confirm.xaml
│   │── TC_Approve_Cancel.xaml
│   │── TC_Reject_Confirm.xaml
│   │── TC_Reject_Cancel.xaml
│   │── TC_Cancel_Confirm.xaml
│   │── TC_Cancel_Cancel.xaml
│
│── 📂 Data
│   │── TestData.xlsx
│   │── Config.json
│
│── 📂 Orchestration
│   │── TestSetDefinition.json
│
│── 📂 Reports
│   │── ExecutionLog.csv
│   │── DashboardExport.json
│
└── Main.xaml   (Entry point for orchestrated runs)

Libraries → everything reusable (publish these as separate libraries if needed).

BusinessFlows → Flowcharts that combine reusable actions.

TestCases → Sequences that call flows.

Data → test data (Excel/CSV/JSON).

Orchestration → test set definitions for Orchestrator.

Reports → logs, exports for dashboards.



---

🔹 2. Building in UiPath Studio (Console)

Step A: Create a Library Project (for Common Controls)

1. Open UiPath Studio → New Project → choose Library.


2. Add reusable workflows (Login.xaml, SelectMenu.xaml, etc.).


3. Use Arguments (not variables!) so they are reusable.

Example: in_Username, in_Password, out_LoginStatus.



4. Publish Library to Orchestrator feed (or local feed).



💡 This keeps your controls DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).


---

Step B: Create a Test Automation Project (Main Framework)

1. Create a new Test Automation Project (not Process).


2. Import your Library from Orchestrator feed.


3. Under BusinessFlows folder, create Flowcharts:

ApproveFlow.xaml: call Login.xaml → call SelectTransactionGrid.xaml → validate → call ClickAction.xaml.

Use Flow Decision for confirm/cancel branching.





---

Step C: Create Test Cases

1. Right-click TestCases → Add New Test Case → Sequence.


2. Inside sequence, call your business flow.


3. Pass test data parameters (from Excel/Config).

Example: TC_Approve_Confirm.xaml calls ApproveFlow.xaml with parameter DecisionType="Confirm".





---

Step D: Test Data Setup

Keep TestData.xlsx simple:


TestCaseID	Username	Password	FlowType	Decision

TC001	user1	pass1	Approve	Confirm
TC002	user1	pass1	Approve	Cancel
TC003	user2	pass2	Reject	Confirm


Read this file at runtime and feed into arguments.



---

Step E: Orchestration

1. Open Orchestrator → Test Sets.


2. Add your Test Cases (Sequences).


3. Group them by flow (Approve Set, Reject Set, Cancel Set).


4. Trigger via Orchestrator or CI/CD pipeline (Azure DevOps, Jenkins).




---

Step F: Reporting

Enable UiPath Insights → auto-dashboards.

Or, export logs to CSV/JSON in Reports folder.

Connect UiPath Test Manager → Jira for requirements traceability and defect sync.



---

🔹 3. Avoiding UiPath “Wizard Hell” (Faster Way)

👉 Instead of using the Test Case Wizard or Recorders for every step (which slows you):

Directly create Sequences/Flowcharts and use Invoke Workflow File to call your reusable controls.

Keep arguments standard (like in_Config, in_TestDataRow, out_Status).

Use Excel/JSON for test data, not the built-in test data service (too much setup for a POC).

Use custom logging (Write Line / Log Message → CSV) instead of full Insights setup if short on time.


This way, you’re showing a framework mindset (layering + reusability) instead of spending time fighting with wizards.


---

✅ By Day 3, your POC will show:

Reusable Libraries (Common Controls)

Business Flows (Approve/Reject/Cancel)

Test Cases (mapped from data)

Orchestrator Test Sets

Reports + Jira sync



---

Do you want me to also give you a ready-to-present workflow diagram (visual) that shows how these layers connect (Library → Flow → Test Case → Orchestrator → Dashboard)? That usually impresses stakeholders more than raw XAMLs.
