## 🧠 **AWS Troubleshooting, Monitoring, and Logging Mind Map (DVA-C02 Cheat Sheet)**

---

### 🌐 **1. AWS X-Ray**

#### Key Features:

* **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests as they travel through your AWS services.
* **Trace Visualization**: Visualize performance bottlenecks and service dependencies.
* **Sampling**: Control the volume of data collected to avoid high overhead.
* **Service Map**: View connections between services and identify latency sources.
* **Error/Exception Tracking**: Identify issues in application code.
* **Integration with CloudWatch**: Correlate X-Ray data with CloudWatch metrics and logs.

#### Use Cases:

* **Microservices**: Track requests across multiple services.
* **Performance Bottlenecks**: Diagnose latency issues in distributed applications.
* **Error Tracking**: Pinpoint code-level issues in production.

### 📊 **2. CloudWatch Logs**

#### Key Features:

* **Centralized Log Storage**: Collect logs from EC2, Lambda, RDS, and other services.
* **Log Groups**: Organize logs by service/application (e.g., `/aws/lambda/my-function`).
* **Log Streams**: Individual log files within a group (e.g., specific Lambda executions).
* **Metrics**: Create custom metrics from log data for alarms.
* **CloudWatch Insights**: Query and analyze logs using SQL-like syntax.
* **Retention Policies**: Define how long logs are stored.
* **Log Subscription**: Stream logs to other services (e.g., Lambda, Kinesis).

#### Use Cases:

* **Application Logs**: Centralize logs from all AWS services.
* **Metrics from Logs**: Generate custom metrics based on log entries.
* **Root Cause Analysis**: Use Insights to find trends or specific errors.

---

### 🛠️ **3. CloudTrail**

#### Key Features:

* **Audit Trail**: Track API calls across AWS services.
* **Event History**: View a history of AWS account activity.
* **Data Events**: Monitor object-level API calls (e.g., S3 PUT, GET).
* **CloudTrail Insights**: Detect unusual activity, such as large numbers of API calls.
* **Integration with CloudWatch**: Use CloudWatch Alarms to react to certain API calls or events.
* **S3 Logging**: Store CloudTrail logs in S3 for long-term access.

#### Use Cases:

* **Security and Compliance**: Track user activity and changes to resources.
* **Forensic Investigations**: Identify unauthorized API calls or security breaches.
* **Operational Troubleshooting**: Investigate operational issues by viewing recent changes.

### 🔍 **4. Service-Specific Logs**

#### **EC2 Logs**:

* **System Logs**: Available via EC2 console or CloudWatch Logs (e.g., EC2 instance state).
* **Instance Metadata Logs**: Monitor network, disk, and CPU metrics.
* **CloudWatch Agent**: Collect custom logs from EC2 instances.

#### **Lambda Logs**:

* **Execution Logs**: Automatically sent to CloudWatch Logs for each function invocation.
* **Cold Starts/Duration**: Track function execution time and cold start issues.
* **Error Handling**: Log errors and exceptions thrown by Lambda functions.

#### **RDS Logs**:

* **General Logs**: Log SQL queries, connections, and disconnections.
* **Slow Query Logs**: Identify slow-performing SQL queries.
* **Error Logs**: Database engine-specific errors (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

#### **S3 Logs**:

* **Access Logs**: Track requests to S3 buckets (GET, PUT, DELETE).
* **Event Notifications**: Trigger Lambda functions or SNS based on object uploads or deletions.

#### **API Gateway Logs**:

* **Access Logs**: Record API requests and responses.
* **Execution Logs**: Detailed logs of requests, responses, and Lambda integration.

#### **ECS Logs**:

* **Task Logs**: Log container outputs via Docker logs, stored in CloudWatch.
* **Service Logs**: Log container health and scaling events.

#### **EKS Logs**:

* **Pod Logs**: Monitor Kubernetes pod logs.
* **Cluster Logs**: CloudWatch integration for cluster-level monitoring.
* **Kubernetes Audit Logs**: Track user and API access within Kubernetes.

### 🚨 **5. Common Exam Trap Scenarios**

| **Scenario**                                        | **Exam Trap**                              | **Correct Answer**                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Troubleshoot slow Lambda function**               | Only check CloudWatch metrics for duration | Check **CloudWatch Logs** for **cold starts**, errors, and exceptions            |
| **API Gateway logs not showing requests**           | Assume API Gateway doesn't log by default  | Enable **Access Logs** and **Execution Logs** in **API Gateway**                 |
| **Need to track unauthorized changes to IAM roles** | Look at CloudWatch Logs                    | Use **CloudTrail** to track IAM changes                                          |
| **Troubleshoot slow ECS container**                 | Check ECS service logs                     | Check **CloudWatch Logs** for container-level logs and **ECS Task Logs**         |
| **Investigate why an S3 bucket is slow**            | Assume performance issue with EC2 instance | Enable **S3 Access Logs** and check **CloudWatch metrics**                       |
| **Lambda is not triggering on new S3 objects**      | Check Lambda logs directly                 | Check **S3 Event Notifications** and **CloudWatch Logs** for Lambda execution    |
| **Troubleshoot missing EC2 instance metadata**      | Check EC2 Console                          | Use **CloudWatch Logs** for instance-level logs and **EC2 Metadata Service**     |
| **Investigating a failed CloudFormation stack**     | Look at CloudFormation console logs        | Check **CloudTrail** logs for the API calls leading to failure                   |
| **Track unauthorized API call attempts**            | Assume CloudWatch metrics will capture all | Use **CloudTrail Insights** for anomaly detection                                |
| **EC2 instance state transitions not recorded**     | Assume they are captured by default        | Use **EC2 Instance Metadata** and **CloudWatch Logs** for instance state changes |
