Here we go!  
**"Final 5 Secret Situations Cheat List" ‚Äî Flashcards to save you from tricky exam traps:**

---

# **5 SECRET SITUATIONS**

### **1. Lambda Cold Start Trap**
- **If exam says:** "low latency, real-time needs, critical operations"
- **THINK:**  
  - **Provisioned Concurrency** (pre-warms Lambdas).
- **Normal Lambdas** have a cold start. Provisioned concurrency removes it.

---

### **2. S3 Security Confusion**
- **If exam says:** "Restrict access to S3 bucket from specific VPC or IPs"
- **THINK:**  
  - **S3 Bucket Policy** + **VPC Endpoint**  
  - (Not ACLs! ACLs are old and basic ‚Äî bucket policies are smarter.)

---

### **3. DynamoDB Capacity Panic**
- **If exam says:** "Sudden spikes or unpredictable traffic"  
- **THINK:**  
  - **On-Demand Capacity Mode**  
  - (Don't waste time manually scaling read/write capacity.)

---

### **4. Database Migration Trick**
- **If exam says:** "Migrate database to AWS with minimal downtime"  
- **THINK:**  
  - **AWS DMS** (Database Migration Service)  
  - **with CDC** (Change Data Capture) for near-zero downtime.

---

### **5. EC2 Health Recovery**
- **If exam says:** "Automatically replace unhealthy EC2 instances"  
- **THINK:**  
  - **EC2 Auto Recovery** (for system failures)  
  - **OR** **Auto Scaling Group** with health checks.

---

# **FAST RECALL TABLE**

| Situation | Go-To Service |
|:---|:---|
| Remove Lambda cold start | Lambda Provisioned Concurrency |
| Secure S3 by VPC/IP | S3 Bucket Policy + VPC Endpoint |
| Handle DynamoDB traffic spikes | DynamoDB On-Demand Capacity |
| Zero downtime DB migration | AWS DMS + CDC |
| Auto-recover EC2 | EC2 Auto Recovery / ASG Health Check |

---

# **YOUR LAST BOOSTER SHOT**
- **Serverless?** = Serverless 3 musketeers: Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB
- **Migration?** = DMS with CDC  
- **Security?** = IAM roles before policies
- **Global apps?** = CloudFront, Route53, Global Accelerator
- **Big data?** = Kinesis, Glue, Athena, Redshift Spectrum
