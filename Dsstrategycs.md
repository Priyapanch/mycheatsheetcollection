## üß† **AWS Deployment Strategies Mind Map**

---

### üåê **1. EC2 Deployment Strategies**

#### **Key Strategies**:

* **Rolling Deployment**:

  * Gradual update of instances in the Auto Scaling Group (ASG).
  * Can be controlled by the **instance health check**.

* **Blue-Green Deployment**:

  * Two identical environments (Blue = current, Green = new version).
  * Traffic switches from Blue to Green after testing Green.

* **Canary Deployment**:

  * Deploy a new version to a small subset of EC2 instances, then gradually increase the percentage.
  * Allows for monitoring of new release impact before full deployment.

* **Immutable Deployment**:

  * Create a completely new environment or ASG with the new version of EC2 instances.
  * Ensures zero downtime by replacing old instances rather than updating them.

#### **Use Cases**:

* **Canary** for quick validation of minor updates.
* **Blue-Green** for safer production swaps.
* **Rolling** for gradual updates without downtime.

---

### üö¢ **2. ECS (Elastic Container Service) Deployment Strategies**

#### **Key Strategies**:

* **Rolling Update**:

  * ECS gradually replaces old tasks with new ones based on the updated service definition.
  * Minimum healthy percent and maximum percent can be configured to control deployment.

* **Blue-Green Deployment**:

  * Two sets of ECS services: one (Blue) for the old version, the other (Green) for the new version.
  * Switch traffic from Blue to Green after testing.

* **Canary Deployment**:

  * Deploy new tasks to a small portion of the ECS cluster.
  * Gradually increase the number of tasks running the new version.

* **Immutable Deployment**:

  * Create new ECS services and switch traffic after testing.
  * Avoids updating running services, ensuring complete version isolation.

#### **Use Cases**:

* **Rolling Updates** for minimal downtime in production.
* **Blue-Green** for safe rollback options.
* **Canary** for gradual, testable deployments.

---

### üê≥ **3. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) Deployment Strategies**

#### **Key Strategies**:

* **Rolling Updates**:

  * Kubernetes deployments automatically roll out new versions of containers, updating pods without downtime.
  * Configurable **maxSurge** and **maxUnavailable** for fine control.

* **Blue-Green Deployment**:

  * Use **Kubernetes Services** to switch traffic between Blue and Green environments.
  * Perform load balancing between the two versions during validation.

* **Canary Deployment**:

  * Deploy new pods to a subset of the cluster.
  * Gradually shift traffic to new pods based on health checks.

* **Recreate Deployment**:

  * Stop old pods and deploy new pods simultaneously.
  * Minimal downtime but involves service disruption during the update.

#### **Use Cases**:

* **Rolling Updates** for seamless Kubernetes upgrades.
* **Blue-Green** for simple rollbacks in Kubernetes environments.
* **Canary** for A/B testing and gradual release.

---

### üå± **4. Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Strategies**

#### **Key Strategies**:

* **All at Once**:

  * Deploy the new version to all instances in one go.
  * This strategy has the highest risk of downtime.

* **Rolling Deployment**:

  * Deploy the new version to a subset of instances, then roll out to others.
  * Provides a balance between speed and availability.

* **Rolling with Additional Batch**:

  * Similar to Rolling, but includes the option to maintain extra capacity during deployment.
  * Helps ensure that no service is disrupted during deployment.

* **Immutable Deployment**:

  * Deploy a new environment with the new application version and switch traffic to it after testing.
  * Zero downtime, but more resource-intensive.

* **Blue-Green Deployment**:

  * Create a new environment with the updated version, then switch traffic after validation.

#### **Use Cases**:

* **Rolling** for gradual updates without downtime.
* **Blue-Green** for easy rollback and testing in isolated environments.
* **All at Once** for non-critical updates where downtime is acceptable.

---

### üîß **5. General Deployment Strategies in AWS**

#### **Key Strategies**:

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:

  * **CloudFormation** or **Terraform** to manage infrastructure in a repeatable and predictable way.
  * Enables easy rollbacks and versioning of infrastructure.

* **Zero Downtime Deployments**:

  * **Auto Scaling** with **Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs)** to ensure high availability during updates.
  * Leverage **Route 53** to manage DNS traffic routing between old and new environments.

* **Canary Releases**:

  * Implement a **weighted routing policy** in **Route 53** or **API Gateway** to direct a portion of traffic to the new version.

* **Feature Toggles**:

  * Deploy the new version of an application with toggles to turn on/off specific features.
  * Use AWS services like **Lambda**, **S3**, or **SNS** to control features in real-time.

* **CI/CD Pipelines**:

  * Use **AWS CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, and **CodeDeploy** for continuous integration and deployment automation.
  * Integrate with GitHub or Bitbucket repositories for version control.
