Awesome!  
**You’re on fire!**  
Here we go — **Day 6 GO + Exam Traps** loaded.

# **Day 6: CI/CD Deep Dive (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk)**

## **Domain Focus:**  
- Automate builds, tests, deployments  
- Choose the right service for right CI/CD stages  
- Handle failures, approvals, blue/green deployments

---

# **Scenario 1:**  
> **You need to build, test, and deploy a Node.js app automatically on every GitHub commit. Which services should you chain together?**

**Answer:**  
- **CodePipeline** = Workflow automation  
- **CodeBuild** = Build & test  
- **CodeDeploy** = Deploy to servers

**Flow:**  
GitHub -> CodePipeline -> CodeBuild -> CodeDeploy

---

# **Scenario 2:**  
> **You need approval before pushing a deployment to production. How can you set this in CodePipeline?**

**Answer:**  
- Add a **Manual Approval** action between stages.

**Pro Tip:**  
- The approver receives an SNS notification (email).

---

# **Scenario 3:**  
> **You want zero downtime deployment to an EC2 group. Which deployment strategy?**

**Answer:**  
- **Blue/Green deployment using CodeDeploy.**

**Memory Hack:**  
- Blue = Current servers  
- Green = New version servers

---

# **Scenario 4:**  
> **You want to easily deploy a full application stack (infra + app) with minimal configuration. Which service?**

**Answer:**  
- **Elastic Beanstalk.**

**Bonus:**  
- It handles EC2, ELB, RDS, auto-scaling — you just provide the app code.

---

# **Scenario 5:**  
> **You want to build a Docker image and push it to ECR automatically. Best service?**

**Answer:**  
- **AWS CodeBuild** (buildspec.yml can automate Docker build + push)

---

# **Critical AWS Service Pitfalls (Exam traps)**

| Wrong Thinking | Correct Thinking |
|:---|:---|
| CodeDeploy is only for EC2 | No — it supports ECS, Lambda, and EC2 |
| Elastic Beanstalk can't customize infra | Wrong — you can use `.ebextensions` |
| CodePipeline stages must always succeed automatically | No — you can insert manual approvals |
| CodeBuild is just for Java | No — CodeBuild supports ANY language (Node.js, Python, Go, Docker etc.) |

---

# **Memory Visual Hack**

**CodePipeline = Conductor**  
(Manages stages.)

**CodeBuild = Builder**  
(Compiles/tests code.)

**CodeDeploy = Delivery Guy**  
(Puts app on servers.)

**Elastic Beanstalk = Butler**  
(Manages full environment.)

# **Cheat Sheet #1: CodePipeline Components**

| Component | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **Source** | GitHub, CodeCommit, S3 |
| **Build** | CodeBuild |
| **Test** | CodeBuild or external testing service |
| **Deploy** | CodeDeploy, ECS, Lambda, Beanstalk |

---

# **Cheat Sheet #2: Deployment Types in CodeDeploy**

| Type | When to Use |
|:---|:---|
| **In-Place (Rolling Update)** | Update servers one by one (short downtime) |
| **Blue/Green** | Zero downtime — swap traffic from old to new |

---

> **Answer:** B

---

### **Q4:**

- B) CodeBuild  
- C) CodePipeline  
- D) Elastic Beanstalk

> **Answer:** B

---

### **Q5:**  
You want to create a new Docker image automatically on every commit and push it to ECR. Best service for building?

- A) CodeBuild  
- B) CodeDeploy  
- C) CloudFormation

> **Answer:** A

---

# **Day 6 Summary Keywords to Memorize:**
> CodePipeline = Orchestrator — CodeBuild = Builder — CodeDeploy = Deployer — Elastic Beanstalk = Environment Manager

# **Bonus: 7 "Exam Trap" Questions to Watch Out For**

| Question | Common Trap | Correct Tip |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **CodeDeploy supports only EC2?** | Wrong | Supports EC2, ECS, Lambda |
| **Elastic Beanstalk good for microservices?** | Sometimes | But ECS/Fargate better for large microservices |
| **CodePipeline automatically retries?** | No | You have to configure retries manually |
| **Manual Approval blocks the pipeline forever?** | No | You can configure timeout on approval step |
| **CodeBuild limited to AWS SDK languages?** | Wrong | Any language if you provide a buildspec.yml |
| **Blue/Green only for ECS?** | No | Also for EC2 via CodeDeploy |
| **Elastic Beanstalk deploys database migrations automatically?** | No | You must configure database hooks separately |
