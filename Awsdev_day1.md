Awesome — **let’s launch Day 1** — **Deployment Mission Critical Tips**.

---

# **Day 1: Deployment (Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, Lambda)**

## **Domain Focus:**  
- **Elastic Beanstalk app deployment** (manage environments)  
- **ECS app deployment** (containerized apps)  
- **Lambda deployment best practices** (layers, container images)

---

## **Scenario 1:**  
> **Your app is deployed using Elastic Beanstalk. After a new deployment, users report the app is down. What is the BEST way to prevent downtime during future deployments?**

**Answer:**  
- Use **Immutable Deployment** in Beanstalk.  
- It spins up a *new* fleet, deploys code there, switches traffic only if healthy.  
- **Never** use AllAtOnce for production (too risky).

**Mini Hack:**  
- **Immutable = Insurance** (new instance first, then traffic)

---

## **Scenario 2:**  
> **You are building a microservice. It needs to run a Python app inside a Docker container on AWS. What is the simplest service to use?**

**Answer:**  
- **ECS Fargate** (serverless container engine).  
- No EC2 management needed. Pay per running task.

**Important Tip:**  
- **Fargate = No server worries.**  
- **ECS EC2 launch type** = you manage servers yourself (not exam-preferred).

---

## **Scenario 3:**  
> **Your Lambda deployment package is exceeding 250MB unzipped size limit. What should you do?**

**Answer:**  
- Use **Lambda container images** (up to 10GB!)  
- Or split code into **Lambda Layers**.

**Mini Tip:**  
- **Layers** = Common code across multiple functions.  
- **Container image** = Full app with its own OS/libs.

# **Critical AWS Service Pitfalls (Exam traps)**

| Wrong Thinking | Correct Thinking |
|:---|:---|
| Elastic Beanstalk = Just code deploy | No — it manages EC2, ALB, Scaling automatically |
| ECS always needs EC2 | No — Fargate is preferred unless you need host control |
| Lambda code can be unlimited | No — regular deployment has strict 250MB limit |

---

# **Memory Visual Hack**

**Elastic Beanstalk = Platform Manager**  
(You choose platform → it handles EC2, Load Balancer, AutoScaling Group)

**ECS = Docker Manager**  
(You choose **Fargate** for serverless, or **EC2** if you want control.)

**Lambda = Function Runner**  
(Just upload code/layers, or use a container.)

---

# **Self-Test:**

> **Q:** Your team wants blue/green deployments without downtime. Which Elastic Beanstalk deployment policy ensures safe rollback if new version is bad?

- A) Rolling  
- B) Rolling with additional batch  
- C) Immutable  
- D) All at once

**(Answer below — don’t peek yet.)**

**Answer: C) Immutable**

# **Day 1 Summary Keywords to Memorize:**
> Immutable Deployment — Fargate Serverless — Lambda Layers — Container Images

**Awesome!  
Let's hit **Day 1: Deployment** — deep, sharp, and exam style.

# **Day 1: Deployment (Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, Lambda)**

---

## **[SCENARIO #1] Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Rollback**

**Question-style Scenario:**  
*"Your team deploys a new app version to Elastic Beanstalk. Suddenly health checks fail. What must be configured to automatically revert to the previous healthy version?"*

**Correct Answer Focus:**  
- Use **Immutable deployments** or configure **Rolling with additional batch** and enable **Auto Rollback**.

**Important to Know:**
- **Immutable deployment**: Deploys new instances separately. If healthy → switch. Safer.
- **Rolling deployment**: Update batches of instances at a time.
- **Rolling with additional batch**: Adds *extra* instances to not disturb capacity.
- **Auto-rollback on failure**: Detects failure and rolls back automatically.

**TRAP to avoid:**  
- _Don’t assume Elastic Beanstalk always auto-rolls back. You have to **configure it**!_

---

## **[SCENARIO #2] ECS Launch Type Decision**

**Question-style Scenario:**  
*"You must run containerized microservices but want to avoid managing EC2 instances. Which ECS launch type is best?"*

**Correct Answer:**  
- **Fargate** launch type.

**Important to Know:**
- **ECS EC2**: You manage the EC2 machines yourself.
- **ECS Fargate**: Fully serverless containers. No EC2 management. Pay per usage.

**TRAP to avoid:**  
- _Don't pick "EKS" if they clearly mention **ECS**._ (Amazon sometimes mixes EKS/ECS to confuse.)

---

## **[SCENARIO #3] Lambda Deployment Package Size Limits**

**Question-style Scenario:**  
*"You have a Lambda function exceeding the 50 MB deployment package limit. How do you deploy it?"*

**Correct Answer:**  
- Use **Lambda container images** (up to 10 GB)  
OR  
- Upload code to **S3** and reference it during Lambda creation.

**Important to Know:**
- Normal deployment package limit = **50 MB zipped**, **250 MB unzipped**.
- **Container images** (Docker) = Max **10 GB** size allowed.
- If using S3, the Lambda code **must be in the same region**.

**TRAP to avoid:**  
- _Don't think just increasing memory will solve package size issues._ (Memory is for runtime, not storage.)

---

# **Today's Memory Visual:**  
Draw this quick in your notes:

```
Elastic Beanstalk: 
  - Rolling
  - Rolling + batch
  - Immutable (best for rollback)

ECS:
  - EC2 → You manage instances
  - Fargate → AWS manages instances

Lambda:
  - 50MB zipped limit
  - 10GB container image limit
  - S3 code reference possible
```

---

# **Today's Self-Test Question:**

_"In Elastic Beanstalk, how can you minimize downtime while updating your app AND prepare for instant rollback if something fails?"_

(Answer: Use **Rolling with additional batch** + **Auto Rollback on Failure**.)
