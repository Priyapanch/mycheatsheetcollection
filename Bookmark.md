What "Blacklisted" Prompts Mean 
Advanced Business & Strategy:
These prompts are designed for complex, strategic tasks like generating new business ideas, analyzing market competition, or building a personal brand, which gives the user a significant competitive edge.
Rarely Shared:
They are called "blacklisted" because they are not common, public-facing queries but rather specialized techniques that users are less likely to share, according to a LinkedIn post.

Unlike simple prompts for writing or getting information, "blacklisted" prompts unlock deeper, transformative AI capabilities for business and personal growth.
