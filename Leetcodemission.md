Got it 👍 Thanks for clarifying.
Since you’re not aiming to compete with juniors but to move into enterprise-level ML/automation leadership, we should refine the LeetCode mission into something more architectural + applied ML pipeline–oriented, instead of grinding 100 standard DSA problems.

Here’s the refined enterprise-level mission for you:


---

🏢 Enterprise-Level LeetCode ML Mission (12 Weeks)

🎯 Core Principle

Focus less on "basic DSA puzzles"

Focus more on scalable ML patterns, automation pipelines, data workflows, and system design

Position you as someone who can architect ML-infused enterprise solutions (leveraging Python, AWS, MongoDB, ETL, DevOps).



---

Phase 1 – Enterprise Data Handling & Patterns (Weeks 1–3)

🔑 Goal: Show mastery in transforming and preparing enterprise-scale data.

Week 1 – Data Transformation Missions

LeetCode style: Prefix Sum, Sliding Window.

Enterprise Twist: Build real-time health claim anomaly detector (streaming averages, percentiles).


Week 2 – High-Volume Data Structures

Problems: Heap, Priority Queue, Top-K.

Enterprise Twist: "Top-K providers by claim rejection rate" from simulated logs.


Week 3 – Graph & Network Problems

Problems: BFS, DFS, Connected Components.

Enterprise Twist: Provider Network Graph → detect disconnected clusters or bottlenecks.




---

Phase 2 – ML Model Building at Scale (Weeks 4–6)

🔑 Goal: Implement ML algorithms from scratch to show deep understanding + enterprise readiness.

Week 4 – Predictive Analytics

Mission: Implement Logistic Regression & Decision Tree from scratch.

Enterprise Twist: Predict "Claim Fraud / No-Fraud" with synthetic dataset.


Week 5 – Clustering & Recommendations

Mission: Implement k-Means and Collaborative Filtering.

Enterprise Twist: Provider ↔ patient recommendation engine.


Week 6 – Time Series & Anomaly Detection

Mission: Implement ARIMA-like rolling forecast.

Enterprise Twist: Predict provider workload spikes or patient claim surges.




---

Phase 3 – Enterprise ML Systems & Pipelines (Weeks 7–9)

🔑 Goal: Translate coding ability into automation + pipeline leadership.

Week 7 – Streaming + ETL Problems

Mission: Sliding Window + Queue-based problems.

Enterprise Twist: Design streaming ETL pipeline (Python + AWS Lambda + MongoDB) → detect anomalies.


Week 8 – Enterprise-Grade Caching & Scaling

Mission: LRU Cache, Rate Limiter (classic LeetCode “Design” problems).

Enterprise Twist: Build provider lookup cache system to reduce DB load.


Week 9 – Distributed ML Simulation

Mission: Parallelize k-Means using multiprocessing in Python.

Enterprise Twist: Architect ML job orchestration (batch training on AWS).




---

Phase 4 – Enterprise Architecture Challenges (Weeks 10–12)

🔑 Goal: Solve problems that mirror enterprise ML adoption challenges.

Week 10 – ML Ops in Action

Mission: Write pipeline to train, evaluate, and deploy model → automate with Python + AWS SDK.


Week 11 – End-to-End Enterprise Problem

Given: Provider-Patient dataset (synthetic).

Build:

1. Data preprocessing (ETL-style).


2. Feature engineering.


3. Train classifier.


4. Expose inference as API.




Week 12 – Enterprise ML Hackathon (Capstone)

Mission: Combine all pieces:

Streaming ingestion

Anomaly detection

ML model training

Serving predictions via API

Logging + monitoring




Deliverable → Enterprise ML Automation Case Study (you can even present this internally at TCS or for future roles).


---

🛠️ Weekly Rhythm (Enterprise Mode)

2 days: Solve LeetCode-inspired core problems (for algorithmic sharpness).

3 days: Enterprise-flavored mission (ML pipeline, data handling, AWS integration).

1 day: Document → turn into architecture notes/mini whitepaper.

1 day: Review + rest.



---

✨ End Result:

Not just "I solved 300 LeetCode problems."

Instead: "I built and solved enterprise ML pipeline challenges (data prep → ML → deployment)."

This positions you as an Enterprise ML Automation Architect, not a junior problem solver.

Would you like me to convert this into a professional PDF tracker with checkboxes + weekly deliverables, so you can use it as a structured self-project + portfolio artifact?
