### 🌍 **1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

#### Key Components:

* **Instances**: Virtual servers for scalable computing.
* **AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)**: Pre-configured OS images.
* **Instance Types**: Variety for compute, memory, storage (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large).
* **Elastic IP (EIP)**: Static public IP for EC2.
* **Security Groups (SG)**: Virtual firewall for controlling inbound/outbound traffic.
* **Key Pairs**: For SSH/RDP access.
* **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjust the number of instances based on load.
* **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across instances.

---

### 🐳 **2. ECS (Elastic Container Service)**

#### Key Components:

* **ECS Cluster**: Group of EC2 instances running containerized applications.
* **Task Definitions**: Blueprint for defining Docker containers in ECS.
* **Task**: Running container in ECS.
* **Service**: Manages the deployment and scaling of tasks.
* **Fargate**: Serverless compute for containers, no EC2 instances.
* **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: Private Docker image repository.
* **Load Balancer**: For distributing traffic to ECS tasks.
* **Service Discovery**: Allows ECS tasks to discover other services dynamically.

---

### 🧑‍💻 **3. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**

#### Key Components:

* **Kubernetes Cluster**: Managed cluster for deploying containers.
* **Node Groups**: EC2 instances running Kubernetes nodes.
* **Kubernetes API**: Communication layer for clusters and workloads.
* **Kubelet**: Agent on each node managing container deployment.
* **Kubernetes Pods**: Running containers in EKS.
* **Deployment**: Managing and scaling containerized applications.
* **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes applications.
* **Fargate for EKS**: Serverless for Kubernetes workloads.
* **AWS Load Balancer Controller**: Manages load balancer for services running on EKS.

---

### 🌐 **4. Elastic Beanstalk**

#### Key Components:

* **Environment**: An application running in Elastic Beanstalk.
* **Application Version**: Version of the deployed app.
* **Environment Tier**: Web Server or Worker.
* **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: For distributing traffic to EC2 instances in Beanstalk.
* **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts instances based on demand.
* **Elastic Beanstalk CLI (EB CLI)**: For managing deployments and environments.
* **Managed Platform**: Automatically handles infrastructure and scaling.

### 🚨 **5. Common Exam Trap Scenarios**

| **Scenario**                                                      | **Exam Trap**                                  | **Correct Answer**                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scaling EC2 instances in response to traffic**                  | Manual scaling assumed                         | Use **Auto Scaling** for automatic scaling                                   |
| **Need to run containers without managing EC2**                   | Use ECS with EC2 instances                     | Use **ECS with Fargate** (serverless container service)                      |
| **Application needs scaling and load balancing**                  | Use EC2 instances directly                     | Use **Elastic Beanstalk** or **ECS** with **Load Balancer**                  |
| **Running a containerized app on ECS**                            | Assume EC2 management required                 | Use **Fargate** (no EC2 management needed)                                   |
| **Access Kubernetes clusters for monitoring**                     | Use IAM roles for direct API access            | Use **kubectl** with **IAM authentication**                                  |
| **Need to deploy an application with autoscaling**                | EC2 instance manually scaled                   | Use **Elastic Beanstalk** for auto-scaling applications                      |
| **Create a custom Kubernetes controller for autoscaling**         | Use ECS Task Definitions for scaling control   | Use **Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** (HPA)                           |
| **Serverless compute for Kubernetes containers**                  | Use EC2 instance types for Kubernetes nodes    | Use **Fargate for EKS** for serverless Kubernetes compute                    |
| **Auto-scaling ECS tasks on demand**                              | Rely on manual task scaling                    | Set **desired count** and enable **service auto-scaling** for ECS            |
| **Elastic Beanstalk environment without a load balancer**         | Assume direct EC2 instance access              | Use **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** in Beanstalk environment                 |
| **Running an application with different deployment environments** | Assume manual management of environments       | Use **Elastic Beanstalk Environments** to manage multiple stages (dev, prod) |
| **Kubernetes workload scaling issue**                             | Assume EC2-based scaling                       | Use **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** for Kubernetes pod scaling           |
| **Deploying containers without Docker registry**                  | Use external Docker registry                   | Use **ECR** (Elastic Container Registry) for private Docker image storage    |
| **Scaling ECS services based on CPU load**                        | Use EC2 instance scaling                       | Use **ECS Service Auto Scaling** to scale based on resource usage            |
| **Elastic Beanstalk application version rollback**                | Assume application version is manually updated | Use **Elastic Beanstalk CLI** or **Management Console** to perform rollbacks |
