# **Day 9: AWS CI/CD for Developers**

## **Domain Focus:**
- CodeCommit
- CodeBuild
- CodePipeline
- CodeDeploy
- Developer Tools integration with Lambda, ECS, EC2

---

# **Scenario 1:**  
> **You want to store your application's source code in AWS. Which service do you use?**

**Answer:**  
- **AWS CodeCommit** â€” managed Git repository in AWS.

---

# **Scenario 2:**  
> **You want to build, test, and package your code automatically when developers push to CodeCommit. What service helps here?**

**Answer:**  
- **AWS CodeBuild** â€” fully managed continuous integration service.

---

# **Scenario 3:**  
> **You want to orchestrate a full pipeline (code â†’ build â†’ deploy) automatically. What AWS service?**

**Answer:**  
- **AWS CodePipeline** â€” orchestrates multi-stage CI/CD workflows.

---

# **Scenario 4:**  
> **You want to deploy an updated application to a fleet of EC2 instances automatically with rollback if a failure happens. Which service?**

**Answer:**  
- **AWS CodeDeploy** â€” deploys to EC2, Lambda, or ECS with rollback and deployment strategies.

---

# **Scenario 5:**  
> **You want to trigger a Lambda function deployment after a successful CodePipeline stage. How?**

**Answer:**  
- Add a **Lambda Action** in CodePipeline â€” trigger a Lambda invocation on stage success.

# **CI/CD Exam Traps (DONâ€™T FALL FOR THESE!)**

| Wrong Thinking | Correct Thinking |
|:---|:---|
| CodeBuild stores artifacts forever | NO â€” You must store artifacts in S3 or CodeArtifact |
| CodeDeploy only supports EC2 | NO â€” Also supports **Lambda** and **ECS** |
| CodePipeline automatically secures artifacts | NO â€” You must set up proper S3 bucket policies |
| Rollbacks in CodeDeploy are automatic always | NO â€” Only if deployment fails and rollback config is enabled |
| CodePipeline cannot trigger Lambda | WRONG â€” Lambda can be an action in a stage! |

# **Memory Visual Hack**

**CodeCommit = GitHub inside AWS**  
(Source code repo.)

**CodeBuild = Jenkins inside AWS**  
(Build, test, package code.)

**CodeDeploy = Robot Army Commander**  
(Deploys apps to EC2/ECS/Lambda.)

**CodePipeline = Highway Organizer**  
(Manages entire CI/CD flow.)

---

# **Cheat Sheet #1: CodeDeploy Deployment Types**

| Deployment Type | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **In-Place** | EC2 instances stop the app, update, restart app |
| **Blue/Green** | New instances are launched, traffic is shifted to the new fleet |
| **Lambda Deployments** | Shifts versions using aliases and weighted traffic |

---

# **Cheat Sheet #2: CodePipeline Stages**

| Stage | Action |
|:---|:---|
| Source | CodeCommit or S3 |
| Build | CodeBuild |
| Test | (Optional) additional build/test |
| Deploy | CodeDeploy, Lambda deploy, ECS deploy |
