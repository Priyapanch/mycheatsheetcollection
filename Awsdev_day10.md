- Exam Mnemonics
- Exam Traps
- 20 Mock Rapid-Fire Questions
- Last-Minute Power Boost Strategy

# **SECTION 1: ULTIMATE STRIKE MNEMONICS**

| Topic | Mnemonic | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **API Gateway Integration** | **DLMI** | Direct, Lambda, Mock, AWS Integration |
| **S3 Storage Classes** | **SIIIG** | Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Infrequent Access, Glacier |
| **Serverless Stack** | **SAL** | S3 + API Gateway + Lambda |
| **Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Policies** | **AIRP** | All at once, Immutable, Rolling, Rolling with additional batch |
| **IAM Policy** | **ARPD** | Allow, Resource, Principal, Deny |
| **CodePipeline Stages** | **SBTD** | Source → Build → Test → Deploy |

---

# **SECTION 2: BIG EXAM TRAPS TO AVOID**

| Trap | Correct Way |
|:---|:---|
| DynamoDB auto-scaling = infinite | NO — You must set **provisioned throughput** or use On-Demand mode |
| Lambda auto scales instantly without limits | NO — Account-level concurrency limits apply |
| API Gateway automatically validates input | NO — You must configure **Request Validators** |
| SQS = Push model | NO — **Polling** model (long-polling preferred) |
| CodeDeploy always auto rollback | NO — Must be explicitly configured! |
| Step Functions automatically retry ALL failures | NO — Only if you configure `Retry` blocks in steps |

---

# **SECTION 3: POWER TECHNIQUE FOR EXAM DAY**

**1. 20/80 Rule:**  
> Focus 80% of your attention on Services heavily tested: Lambda, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CodePipeline.

**2. Time Target:**  
> 65 questions → 130 minutes → **~2 minutes per question.**  
> If stuck, flag & move — comeback later.

**3. Exam Filter:**  
When you see a tricky choice, think:
- **Security?** → IAM, KMS
- **Cost Saving?** → S3-IA, Glacier, Lambda
- **Scalability?** → DynamoDB, Lambda
- **Resilience?** → Multi-AZ, DLQ
